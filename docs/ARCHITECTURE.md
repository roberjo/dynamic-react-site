# System Architecture

## Overview

The Dynamic React Site is built using a modern, scalable architecture that leverages serverless computing and microservices principles. This document outlines the high-level architecture, component interactions, and technology choices.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Architecture

#### Core Components
- **React Application**
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Vite for fast development and building
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - MobX for state management

#### Key Features
- Dynamic Component Loading
- Responsive Design
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Client-side caching

### 2. Backend Architecture

#### API Layer
- **Express.js Server**
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - GraphQL support (optional)
  - Rate limiting and security middleware
  - Request validation

#### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**
  - User data
  - Product metadata
  - Transaction records
  - Audit logs

- **DynamoDB**
  - Flexible product configurations
  - User preferences
  - Caching layer
  - Session data

### 3. Authentication System

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 integration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management

### 4. Infrastructure

#### AWS Services
- Lambda functions for serverless operations
- API Gateway for API management
- S3 for static assets
- CloudFront for CDN
- Route 53 for DNS management

#### Deployment
- Harness for CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CDK

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication Flow**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB/PostgreSQL
   ```

2. **Product Management Flow**
   ```
   Admin UI -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> PostgreSQL/DynamoDB
   ```

3. **Investment Projection Flow**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> Calculation Service -> Response
   ```

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS everywhere
- API key management
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling through Lambda
- Database read replicas
- Caching strategies
- CDN integration
- Load balancing

## Monitoring and Logging

- CloudWatch for metrics
- X-Ray for tracing
- Custom logging solution
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

## Future Considerations

- Microservices migration
- Real-time features
- Enhanced caching
- Multi-region deployment
- Enhanced security measures
